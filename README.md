## Overview

***LovinEscapades*** is a web CRUD application developed as part of Milestone Project 4 in the Full Stack Software Development program at Code Institute. This project showcases a complete full-stack Django development approach, utilizing:

- Python with the Django framework
- JavaScript with jQuery
- Custom CSS

In its present form, ***LovinEscapades*** allows registered users to:

- Log in via the `Log In` page using their username and password
- Create, update, edit, and delete information regarding their trips
- Upload and delete photos associated with a particular trip
- Share information about their trips and images with other users or unregistered site visitors
- Post testimonials (upon site admin approval) about their experiences with the site and its community

For site visitors who are not registered users, it is still possible to:

- View shared trip locations marked on a Leaflet map using georeferenced markers
- Navigate to the `Gallery` page via the links in the marker popups
- Send inquiries to the site admin from the `Contact Us` page
- Register on the site from the `Registration` page

Designed with user-friendliness in mind, ***LovinEscapades*** is an intuitive application aimed at helping users maintain focus and boost engagement. It's important to note that this app serves as a demonstration of acquired full-stack programming skills in fulfillment of the requirements of Milestone Project 4, rather than being a final product.

### Target Audience

***LovinEscapades*** targets travel enthusiasts and individuals who enjoy documenting and sharing their travel experiences. It appeals to users looking to organize their trips, connect with a community, and explore destinations through shared content. Designed with simplicity in mind, the platform suits both tech-savvy individuals and those new to online travel documentation, providing an intuitive space for managing itineraries and memories. The app is designed to accommodate a diverse user base, embracing individuals from varied geographic locales, cultures, and backgrounds globally, fostering a rich exchange of experiences and perspectives.


## Application development
The development of the ***LovinEscapades*** application followed an iterative approach, incorporating essential Agile principles. However, as I was still familiarizing myself with Agile methodologies, I found these principles challenging to follow consistently.

Much of the development process was guided by a trial-and-error approach, as I initially lacked a clear vision of the project content. Despite these challenges, I focused on implementing a select number of user stories to ensure progress.

The user stories were crafted using a custom template, structured as follows::

*<center>**Title:***</center>

*<center>**Description:***</center>
*<center>As a **[role]** I can **[capability]** so that **[received benefit]***</center>

*<center>**Acceptance Criteria:***</center>
*<center>Acceptance Criteria 1:*</center>
*<center>Acceptance Criteria 2:*</center>
*<center>Acceptance Criteria 3:*</center>

Key user stories that influenced development included:
- As a site visitor, I can register for an account or log in to an existing one, so I can access personalized features and services.
- As a registered user, I want the ability to create, edit, and delete a trip record.
- As a registered user, I can create and share my trip, allowing me to document my travel experiences and share them with others.
- As a site visitor, I want a view of shared trip locations and photos.

All the `User Stories` labeled in the `must have` category were fulfilled by the time of project submission.

During development, I encountered numerous bugs and conducted extensive code refactoring to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Frequent Git commits were made throughout the process to ensure consistent progress tracking and effective version control.

## Application structure

### ***Lovingescapades*** project consists of  three apps:

### 1. `trip`
This app features the `Dashboard` page, allowing users to:
- View updated counts of trips, uploaded photos, and testimonials awaiting approval.
- Decide if new trip information will be shared publicly or kept private. Public trips are mapped on the landing page, while private trips are visible only to the authenticated user.
- Quickly access trip details through trip card elements, which provide basic trip information (destination, start and end dates, creation date) along with options to edit/delete trips and upload/delete photos.
- Display approved user testimonials on the landing page and map the locations of shared trips.  

### 2. `user_profile`
The user profile app offers two primary sections:
- Profile update section for editing basic user information such as username, first and last name, and email address.
- Functionality for posting and deleting testimonials, which are subject to admin approval before appearing on the landing page.  

### 3. `contact`
This app provides essential functionality for site visitors to send inquiries to the site admin via a dedicated form.

### 4. `gallery`
- Hosts the photo gallery where all publicly shared photos by registered users can be viewed by any visitor.
- Users can publish photos even if they choose not to make the associated trip information public.
- Each photo in the gallery includes a like icon and basic trip details, though the feature for sending and receiving likes has not been implemented yet.

## Accessibility and Design

### Accessibility
- Attention was given to the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) content, ensuring that screen readers can effectively retrieve information when needed.

### Fonts
- The font 'Lato' was chosen for the logo and related statement text. It is both legible and adds a rough, gritty   texture, breaking the clean visual of the site.
- The font 'Roboto' was used for general text, both offering a clean and easily readable appearance.

### Colors and Themes
- The websiteâ€™s style is minimalistic, primarily based on predefined Bootstrap 5.3 themes and touches of custom CSS. This approach ensures good contrast and a decent aesthetic, supporting accessibility and visual appeal.

### Icons
- Font Awesome were used for the Logo, social media icons in the Footer, `My profile`-page link and like buttons on share photos in the ??`Gallery`-page.

### **JSHint**
The [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) validator flagged two warnings across all JavaScript files concerning the use of Bootstrap 5.3 modals and Leaflet `L` objects.

![Main menu](static/docs/JSHint.webp#center)
*<center><font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: JSHint validator results*.</center><br>

### **Lighthouse**
The Lighthouse validator showed very good results, with an warning related to a Leaflet internal issue.

### Jigsaw CSS Validator

The Jigsaw CSS Validator reported no errors for the custom CSS.

![Main menu](static/docs/W3C-CSS-CustomCSS.webp)
*<center><font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Lighthouse snapshot test*.</center><br>

However, it identified two errors in the Leaflet CSS, both related to Leaflet specifically:

![Main menu](static/docs/W3C-CSS-Errors-URL.webp)
*<center><font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Lighthouse snapshot test*.</center><br>

Upon further investigation using [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com), it was confirmed that `plus-lighter` is a valid value for the `mix-blend-mode` property.

![Main menu](static/docs/CANIUSE_plus-lighter.webp)
*<center><font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Lighthouse snapshot test*.</center><br>

For the second error, no relevant results were found, and I am unable to provide an explanation or a fix.

*<center><font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Lighthouse snapshot test*.</center><br>


### Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) 

The WAVE Tool reports no errors but does issue an alert.

![Main menu](static/docs/WAVE_test.webp)
*<center><font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Lighthouse snapshot test*.</center><br>

Upon investigating further, it suggests that both the site logo and the "Home" navbar element have the same link pointing to the homepage. I have not addressed this alert because having multiple links leading to the home page is a common practice and does not typically impede navigation or accessibility.

![Main menu](static/docs/WAVE_test_alert.webp)
*<center><font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Lighthouse snapshot test*.</center><br>

Finally, the WAVE contrast check test also passes successfully.
